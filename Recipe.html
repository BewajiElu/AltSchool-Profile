    <!-- Additional Information -->

    <h2>Tips</h2>
    <p>
      For extra fluffy pancakes, let the batter rest for 5 minutes before
      cooking. You can also add blueberries or chocolate chips for variety.
    </p>

    <section>
      <h2>When to Flip Pancakes</h2>
      <p>
        Your pancake will tell you when it's ready to flip. Wait until bubbles
        start to form on the top and the edges look dry and set. This will
        usually take about two to three minutes on each side.
      </p>

      <h2>How to Reheat Pancakes</h2>
      <p>
        Store leftover pancakes in an airtight container in the fridge for about
        a week. Refrain from adding toppings (such as syrup) until right before
        you serve them so the pancakes don't get soggy.
      </p>

      <h2>Can You Save Pancake Batter?</h2>
      <p>
        Don't let leftover pancake batter go to waste! Store the batter in an
        airtight container in the fridge for up to two days. If you plan to keep
        it longer than that, it's best to freeze the batter.
      </p>

      <h2>Can You Freeze Pancakes?</h2>
      <p><em>Yes, you can freeze pancakes and pancake batter.</em></p>
      <p>
        <u>To freeze cooked pancakes</u>: Allow the pancakes to cool completely,
        then arrange them in a single layer on a baking sheet (make sure the
        edges aren't touching). Flash freeze for a few hours or up to overnight.
        Reheat in an oven set to 350Â°F until warmed through.
      </p>
      <p>
        <u>To freeze pancake batter</u>: Ladle the pancake batter in serving
        size portions into freezer bags, then wrap the bags in foil. Freeze flat
        for up to one month. Thaw in the refrigerator overnight.
